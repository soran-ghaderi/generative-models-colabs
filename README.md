# Generative Models Notebooks

Welcome to the collection of notebooks exploring various generative models. This repository provides hands-on tutorials and experiments to help you understand and implement different generative modeling techniques.

## Navigation

The notebooks are organized by model type. Below you will find a list of available notebooks with brief descriptions.

## 1. Energy-Based Models (EBMs)

Energy-Based Models learn an energy function that assigns low energy values to "real" data points and high energy values to "fake" or unlikely data points.

*   **[Training an EBM with Contrastive Divergence](./Training_EBM_Contrastive_Divergence.ipynb)**
    *   This notebook provides a tutorial on training a simple EBM on a synthetic dataset using the `torchebm` library. It covers defining the energy function, using Langevin Dynamics for sampling, and applying Contrastive Divergence for training.
